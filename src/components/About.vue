            <p class="text-muted">The desire to organize a kennel appeared after the acquisition of a puppy of breed
Boston Terrier. The breed really sunk into the soul, but could not supplant the love of the breed Cane Corso. Therefore, the name of the kennel "GALAKTIC GRAVITY" was given in honor of the first Cane dog - Corso ESTELLUM GALACTIC FIRST.
Dogs are surrounded by love, care and attention, independently participating in exhibitions, breeding and playing sports. They are all members of our family.</p>
